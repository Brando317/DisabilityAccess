      <h1>About Blind Professionals Network (BPN)</h1>
<p>      Blind Professionals Network (BPN) was founded in 2019 by Victoria Hillard, a totally blind professional mom of five,  with a simple yet profound vision: to create a dedicated space for blind and visually impaired professionals. While many social support groups existed, Victoria noticed a significant gap-there wasn't a focused community for individuals to discuss their work experiences, challenges, and triumphs. BPN started as an essential support group, a place where members could connect, share insights, and offer practical strategies to overcome workplace obstacles, all within a community that truly understood and related to their unique experiences.
      Our Evolution: (From Support Group to Empowerment Hub)
      The onset of COVID-19, in 2020, prompted BPN to recognize an even greater opportunity to serve the blind and visually impaired community. We observed the alarmingly high unemployment rate among blind and visually impaired individuals and identified several common barriers preventing them from securing and maintaining employment. These included a lack of training, insufficient skills, limited awareness that employment is possible, and a significant lack of confidence. This last point resonated deeply with those who, like Victoria, experienced sight loss in adulthood and mistakenly believed their professional lives were over.
      Victoria herself became blind at age 30 due to Neuromyelitis Optica. She intimately understood the feeling of despair and the misconception that professional aspirations were no longer attainable. Overcoming this belief, she became fiercely passionate about helping others realize their full potential and understand that they can absolutely achieve their career goals, regardless of the degree of sight loss. Henceforth, she set out to construct a powerhouse team of like minded and driven peers to formulate the rapidly expanding 501(C)(3) Charitable Organization known as Blind Professionals Network. BPN is the platform through which she helps make this a reality.
      Our Commitment: Empowerment Through Accessibility.</p>
      <p>At BPN, we believe that financial circumstances should never be a barrier to professional success. This core belief is why all our programs and services are offered completely free of charge. Thanks to the generous support of our donors and dedicated volunteers, BPN provides a variety of programs and services designed to equip blind and visually impaired individuals with the skills and confidence needed to excel in their job search and navigate their career journeys successfully.
      BPN is dedicated to fostering a community where every blind and visually impaired professional feels empowered, supported, and ready to achieve their highest aspirations.</p>

      <h3>ABOUT BPN  FOUNDER</h3>
      
      <h4>Victoria Hillard, Founder & Executive Director</h4>
      <p>Victoria Hillard is the visionary Founder and Executive Director of the Blind Professionals Network (BPN), an organization born from her deep-seated passion to empower blind and visually impaired individuals in their professional journeys. Her leadership is rooted in a unique blend of personal experience, unwavering advocacy, and a profound commitment to fostering inclusive workplaces.</p>
      <p>Victoria's journey to founding BPN in 2019 was driven by a critical observation: while social support networks for the blind and visually impaired existed, there was a significant absence of a dedicated space for professionals to address career-specific challenges. This insight was profoundly shaped by her own experience of becoming blind at the age of 30 due to Neuromyelitis Optica. She intimately understood the misconceptions and emotional hurdles that can accompany adult-onset sight loss, including the erroneous belief that professional aspirations might be over.</p>
      <p>A dedicated community leader, Victoria's commitment to serving the blind and visually impaired community extends beyond BPN. She brings a wealth of experience from her role as the Manager of Education and Training at the Houston Lighthouse for the Blind, where she was instrumental in developing programs to enhance independence and employability. Her leadership also shines as the Vice-President of the Houston Area Visually Impaired Network, where she is heavily involved in events and activities that enrich the lives of community members.</p>
      <p>Victoria's professional background is further distinguished by her entrepreneurial journey as a personal and professional coach for over 15 years. This extensive experience has honed her ability to guide individuals in overcoming obstacles, identifying strengths, and achieving their goals, skills she now brings to bear daily at BPN. She is also an active Associate, deeply involved in various initiatives aimed at supporting the community.</p>
      <p>Victoria holds an Associates degree in Psychology and a Bachelor's degree in Human Services, providing her with a robust academic foundation in understanding human behavior and community support structures. Her tireless efforts and compassionate leadership continue to inspire and uplift countless individuals within the blind and visually impaired community, paving the way for a more equitable and inclusive professional landscape.</p>
      
      <p>Under Victoria's guidance, BPN has evolved from a vital support group into a comprehensive empowerment hub. She recognized the urgent need to address the high unemployment rate among the blind and visually impaired by focusing on critical areas such as skills development, confidence-building, and fostering awareness. Her strategic vision during the COVID-19 pandemic transformed BPN, enabling it to offer vital, free programs and services to a wider audience, ensuring that financial barriers never impede success.</p>
