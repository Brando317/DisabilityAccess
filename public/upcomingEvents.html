      <h2>Calendar</h2>

<p>The month of July is always a hiatus month for BPN. With all the conventions, expos, and summer vacations, we feel this is a great time to take a summer break! BPN will resume regularly scheduled Zoom meetings on the first Wednesday in August, which will be on August 3rd. Please check back the last week of July for the updated BPN events. Also be sure to follow all our social media platforms, direct links on contact page, to keep up with BPN day-to-day doings! Best wishes for a happy and safe summer to you all!</p>
