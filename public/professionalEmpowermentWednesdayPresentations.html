    <ul>
        <li><strong>Assistive Technology for the Workplace</strong>: Demonstrations and discussions on the latest screen readers, magnifiers, refreshable braille displays, and other adaptive technologies that enhance productivity and accessibility for blind professionals.</li>
        <li><strong>Navigating Career Advancement as a Blind Professional</strong>: Insights from experienced HR professionals and blind entrepreneurs on resume building, interview strategies, networking, and advocating for accommodations.</li>
        <li><strong>Financial Literacy and Planning for Individuals with Disabilities</strong>: Workshops on budgeting, investment strategies, disability benefits, and long-term financial security tailored for the blind and visually impaired community.</li>
        <li><strong>Entrepreneurship and Small Business Development</strong>: Resources and guidance for blind individuals interested in starting their own businesses, including funding opportunities, legal considerations, and marketing strategies.</li>
