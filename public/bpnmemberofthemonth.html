    <p> Tricia Waechter is the founder and CEO of BLIND GIRL DESIGNS. She has retinitis pigmentosa, and has a 10° visual field remaining.  Tricia’s entire career has been in the creative arts in either theater or fashion design. When the Retinitis Pigmentosa ended, her options of being able to actively work in a corporation in the creative field, she was devastated.  Truthfully though, she had been aware of this possibility for decades, and enthusiastically traveled to all seven continents and 48 countries, which actually fit perfectly within her work. She is a big fan of bucket lists and crossing off stuff on bucket lists. After a rough patch of  rapid sight loss, she worked through the resulting depression with a therapist and , Tricia rallied. She founded BLIND GIRL DESIGNS on January 1, 2021. Her primary goal is to normalize blindness within the community. Acceptance, love ,empathy, Optimism are her key beliefs and building blocks in this endeavor. </p>
